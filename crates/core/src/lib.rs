//! Plumbing for the plugin in this repo: libobs FFI, symbol resolution,
//! calldata, `obs_data`, and the metering loop itself.
//!
//! Nothing here reads or writes OBS state beyond what it is handed. There
//! is no function in this crate that changes an OBS setting, and none that
//! registers a vendor request — that is what lets the README describe the
//! plugin as read-only without asking anyone to take it on trust.
//!
//! # A second copy of this code exists — fix bugs in both
//!
//! This crate began life inside `hoversights/framesw-obs-plugin`, and that
//! repository still has its own copy under `crates/core`. The two were one
//! crate, consumed from here by git revision, until this plugin was ready
//! to publish; a plugin strangers load into their own OBS should not need a
//! commercial product's repository in order to build.
//!
//! The copies are deliberately **not** identical. This one is a subset:
//! everything serving a vendor request, an NDI audio tap, or an OBS config
//! write was removed, and each removal left a comment where the code was.
//! But the FFI declarations, the refcount conventions and the metering
//! callback are shared ancestry, and a mistake in any of them crashes OBS
//! itself rather than just this plugin.
//!
//! **So: a fix to anything FFI-critical here almost certainly applies over
//! there too, and vice versa.** There is no tooling that will remind you.
//! The same warning is at the top of the other copy.
