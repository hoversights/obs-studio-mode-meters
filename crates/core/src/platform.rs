//! Cross-platform "find this libobs/obs-websocket symbol somewhere

//! file (`calldata.rs`, `obs_data.rs`, `lib.rs`) is identical C-ABI logic
//! on both platforms, since libobs's own API doesn't vary by OS.
//!
//! Deliberately **runtime** symbol resolution (`dlsym`/`GetProcAddress`)
//! rather than link-time `extern "C"` declarations against an import
//! library: macOS and Windows have genuinely different models for how a
//! plugin's undefined symbols get satisfied by its host process at link
//! time (macOS: `-Wl,-undefined,dynamic_lookup` defers it to load time
//! for free; Windows: normally requires linking against a `.lib` import
//! library generated from OBS's own SDK, which this project doesn't
//! have/want to depend on). Resolving everything at runtime instead means
//! both platforms share **one** mechanism and this crate needs zero
//! platform-specific linker configuration at all.
